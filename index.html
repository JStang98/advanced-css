            <h3>Survived one(1) week with Gary Almes</h3>
              <p>Althought at times, difficult, I have managed to endure a solid week of Gary's uproariously hilarious jokes. I must admit that I am rather intimidated by his raw comedeic prowess at times, yet I have prevailed.</p>

        <h2>Placeholder Image of a Capybara</h2>
          <p>Hello! My name as you may have guessed, is Jackson Stang. I am a junior fullstack developer in training! I'm hoping for a long and successful career in the tech field, and I have constructed this satirical Portfolio to demonstrate my burgening skills as a web developer.</p>
            <h2>My Goals for this program</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>During this course, I plan on learing the follwing languages: 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', and 'Python'</li>
              <li>In edition to learning the previously mentioned coding languages, I also aspire to improve at premoting my professional Image.</li>
              <li>Finally, I want to be able to experience the personal satisfaction of learning a skillset that is not only challenging, but invaluable in a progressivly digital world. I hope that the skills I learn throughout the duration of this program, will bear fruit that will be useful and interesting for not only myself, but my collegues and superiors as well.</li>

        <section class="website-a"> 
          <h2>Website A: Gongle</h2>
          <img src="./assets/gogle.png" alt="gongle" height="150" width="300">
            <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&ictx=2&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiopKrgl8yBAxUElYkEHdY5DD8QPQgK">Check it out here!</a>
            <p>This is totally a real website I made by myself. Yes that's right, I am the sole creator of the number one most used search engine in human history! Of course I am exceptionally humble about this indisputable fact, no need to praise me.</p>
        </section>
      <section class="website-b">
        <h2>Website B: Bingus</h2>
          <img src="./assets/bingus.png" alt="Milosoft bingus">
            <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Check out this HOT new search engine!</a>
              <p>While many consider 'Gongle.com' to be my magnum opus, there are a fair amount of detractors who vastly prefer my other work, which I lovingly refer to as 'Bingus'</p>
      </section>

      <section blass="website-c">
        <h2>Website C: Duck Go Duck</h2>
          <img src="./assets/duckgo.png" alt="Duck Go Duck">
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">You get the idea, just click the link!</a>
              <p>Did I say the last one was hot? Well, this one is downright volcanic! Are you tired of multi-trillion dollar tech giants (who have shamelessly coopted MY intellectual propert) promoting websites that have little to nothing to do with what you were actually searching for? Well my latest masterpiece 'Duck Go Duck' has just what you're looking for! No more hiding links due to backend corperate payouts, search uninhibited here!  </p>
