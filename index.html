            <h3>Survived one(1) week with Gary Almes</h3>
              <p>Althought at times, difficult, I have managed to endure a solid week of Gary's uproariously hilarious jokes. I must admit that I am rather intimidated by his raw comedeic prowess at times, yet I have prevailed.</p>

          <h3>Completed one(1) assignment in a timely manner</h3>
            <p>With sheer confidence and grace, I have not only completed the first assignment given to me, BUT have also turned said assignment in exactly on the due date.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Has perfect attendance</h3>
            <p>I have attended each and every class in a punctual manner. Clearly demonstrating my grit and determination for tenderizing my entire brain, rewiring it to EXCLUSIVLY think in html syntax (working on the other languages as we speak)</p>

          <h2>Website A: Gongle</h2>

            <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&ictx=2&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiopKrgl8yBAxUElYkEHdY5DD8QPQgK">Check it out here!</a>
            <p>This is totally a real website I made by myself. Yes that's right, I am the sole creator of the number one most used search engine in human history! Of course I am exceptionally humble about this indisputable fact, no need to praise me.</p>
        </section>
      <section class="website-b">
        <h2>Website B: Bingus</h2>
          <img src="./assets/bingus.png" alt="Milosoft bingus">
            <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Check out this HOT new search engine!</a>
              <p>While many consider 'Gongle.com' to be my magnum opus, there are a fair amount of detractors who vastly prefer my other work, which I lovingly refer to as 'Bingus'</p>

        <h2>Website C: Duck Go Duck</h2>
          <img src="./assets/duckgo.png" alt="Duck Go Duck">
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">You get the idea, just click the link!</a>
              <p>Did I say the last one was hot? Well, this one is downright volcanic! Are you tired of multi-trillion dollar tech giants (who have shamelessly coopted MY intellectual propert) promoting websites that have little to nothing to do with what you were actually searching for? Well my latest masterpiece 'Duck Go Duck' has just what you're looking for! No more hiding links due to backend corperate payouts, search uninhibited here!  </p>
