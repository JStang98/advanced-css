# advanced-css

## Portfolio (Homework2)
The Advanced CSS Portfolio project was made to demonstrate what I have learned and applied during my studies.

## Usage
You can use this satirically tinged website to observe the aspects of CSS and HTML I have applied in my work. Along with my general design sensibilities (to the extent I am able to implement them). In edition, I have used this project as an oppertunity to design my own image assets, crude as they may be. (*italic image assets for website(s) B and C were designed by myself using Clip Studio Paint* )
